0,"My story starts in 2004 although I was n't diagnosed until 2005 . In Oct 2004 , mammo showed some calcifications . Had steriotactic biopsy which showed atypical ductal hyperplasia -LRB- ADH -RRB- , then had surgical biopsy which showed atypical lobular hyperplasia -LRB- ALH -RRB- . Fast forward to Sep 2005 . Had diagnostic mammo and ultrasound requested by breast surgeon due to ADH/ALH . Mammo was clear but ultrasound showed suspicious mass . Ultrasound guided biopsy showed invasive ductal -LRB- IDC -RRB- , grade 2 . IDC was thought to be multi-focal at 1.4 cm and 3 mm . Opted for bi-lateral mastectomy with immediate reconstruction due to dense breasts and mammo missing cancer . Bi-lateral mastectomy in Oct 2005 , left breast : 2.1 cm insitu and infiltrating mammary carcinoma with ductal and lobular features -LRB- IDLC -RRB- , grade 1 with one pos node out of 8 . Strongly ER/PR pos and her2 neg . Right breast : ALH so noncancer breast would have probably cooked up the same thing down the road . Had dose dense chemo AC/T and radiation to chest wall , auxilla and supraclavicle nodes . Was 49 and premenopausal at diagnosis . Chemo put me in chemopause . Started Tamoxifen in Apr 06 before rads and after rads had an oophorectomy and started Arimidex . Have been on Arimidex for a year . My sister was diagnosed with breast cancer a year and a half before me , also stage II with one positive node and the same size tumor , which we both think is weird . I had genetic testing done and tested negative for brac 1 & 2 . ",True
6,I 'm in the same boat as you . I 've tried all the hormonals and chemo is my only choice now too .

Ca n't really remember the lowest the platelet count was when they did chemo but I know it was above 50 . Whenever I get a transfusion my counts are good enough to get chemo the next week .

0,"Hello all thought I would share my last visit to the Med Onc , he decided to check for blood clots due to some tenderness in the calves and more frequent cramps . all is fine but he stressed to make sure I note any changes and to make sure to report any further changes or unusual pain that i have not had before . I then was given a flu shot , on my way home the nurse called and said that she had made a mistake and given me a double dose . She called the CDC , the serum manufacturere and all assured her I would be fine but may have a sore arm and run a fever for a few days , minor flu like symtons and yup I am . Last year no side effects . She was very apologetic , I felt good that they had coverd the bases and checked with everyone to make sure all would be ok . All done with my Rads Onc . I am one of the few who has a chronic rash on my radiated breast that may not go away and may give me minimum discomfort as it does now . At least I know , he also told me not to be concerned if I get veins showing in my breast a few years down the road . I really am feeling well so no complaints .

When I had my bilateral mastectomies in 04 , I tried expanders but had issues with them after radiation and one failed -LRB- left a stupid HOLE in my chest ! -RRB- . I am tall -LRB- 6 ' 2 '' -RRB- with an athletic build , so I did n't have much spare belly fat for a DIEP and with the athletics , I did n't want to have muscle moved or manipulated -LRB- so TRAM and Lat flaps were out -RRB- . As the top of my rear end also did n't have enough fat to harvest two breasts -LRB- doc said it was `` too muscular '' - who knew ?!? -RRB- , my only option was an IGAP . Although It is a big surgery - in that it is a long time to be under anesthesia -LRB- mine took 11 hours -RRB- and the recovery -LRB- as in being able to do all the things you were able to do before surgery , which for me , that meant karate , running and lifting weights -RRB- is longer than with implants - I 'd do it again in a heartbeat . The pain was n't bad at all and the `` I ca n't reach down to tie my shoes ! '' phase did n't last long . I was able to walk on a treadmill two and a half weeks out , was back to karate by week five and back to my full lifting schedule by week six .

2,"My friends : I met with my oc yesterday and got the news the treatment will be Carboplatin/Taxotere for 6 months every 3 weeks , and Herceptin every week because I am Her2 positive 100 % . The cancer loves that estrogene . I ask for the Pathology report and trying to figure it out , even with the chart in here is perplexing . Final results is Lymph Node Metastatic Adenocarcinoma , Breast Primary . The stain was consistant with breast cancer even though the lump is in my arm pit . What is scarying me is the clinical impression is metastatic carcinoma of unkown primary -LRB- CUP for short -RRB- What I have been reading the prognosis with CUP is poor . I felt so uplifted by the spirit of the Dr and Chemo team when I visited the office , but when I read all this stuff today I just broke down and cried this morning . Before I thought the worst and told you at that time I was so down that any news they gave me would n't bring me any lower and that would be good . After the visit I saw some light and felt their positive outlook as good for me . Then this just crashes me back down to the first level . I took a Cat Scan yesterday as that is what they look for is cancer in the lungs with this , and a Bone Scan on Monday , also a test to see if it is there if it is pancreatic cancer . Most Adenocarcinomas have these traits . I 'm just beside myself and so depressed it is awful . I have cried most of the day . Am I not seeing all the picture until all the results are in ? Am I worrying over nothing ?? The prognosis of these articles are a median survival of approximately 3 to 4 months with less than 25 % and 10 % of patients alive at 1 and 5 years . CUP is represented by a heterogeneous group of diseases all of which have presented with metastasis as the primary manifestation . This is all from just a needle biopsy .

Others I have talked to said it is good to drink a lot of water and that should help some and also warm compresses on your good arm and hand . I 'm not sure why this happens , but apparently it is not that uncommon for us . My arm and hand is still bruised and it 's been almost 2 weeks since my expander exhange surgery . The anestesiologist stuck me 4 times before he got a vein that would not collapse to start the IV for surgery . So do n't feel alone ! I know how you feel ... and it is frustating and painful . Hopefully most of this is behind you now ! ",True
2,"Posted this on the reconstruction forum too but I really need advice . Had bilat mx 6/15/09 for bilat stage 1 IDC with immediate tissue extender placement . Insurance restricted my PS choice to only one MD who said I was not a candidate for flap procedure . One incision has not closed due to excessive fluid pressure and non-stop drainage . Extender must now be removed with 8 wk heal period before reinsertion . Had to rush into decision in order to get only PS available on board , but now I will have weeks to think and am terribly confused . Wondering if at 62 , I really want to do go through with it . Really concerned about implant complications , especially contracture and leakage in light of looming gov ' t healthcare restrictions down the road . I ca n't afford to pay for replacements or for MRIs to check silicone stability out of pocket . Do not want to mess with prostheses and am surprisingly happy with the way I look now even though I had a 34D before but I still have the extenders in with 50cc H2O and I worry about what I read about concavity and lumpiness if I now opt out of reconstruction . Please share any experiences with opting out of implants or problems with saline or silicone implants you 've had so I can read your experiences and decide what is best for me . ",True
0,"Amy - I asked my Dr. a few weeks ago . he said a small part of my lung was being radiated and it was just brushing my heart . He said it was n't any big deal , but it could show up on a chest x-ray and then tell them at that time about the radiation . I knew this from reading on the internet , that when it 's your left breast , this is pretty much inevitable . It also said that years down the road there is a slight chance of heart problems , but it is rare . Oh , well , what can you do ? Just try and not think about it . I 'm just so happy I had my last full radiation today , yea ! , and start my 6 boosts tomorrow . I 'll be done a week from tomorrow . ",True

Purchase the small sizes of things you use regularly - no gallons of milk to lift ! Move things to low shelves . I had my husband to help ; you 'll have your girls and they will want to help so let them . I only took pain meds at night because they make me groggy and I wanted to be awake in the day , but I did take lots of naps . Short walks , range of motion exercises , light meals , more naps . Wash your hair the morning of your surgery because it 'll be awhile before you can reach up that high again . I could take a bath with low water that first week , then was released to shower as long as the water only hit my back . Get a couple of loose button-up shirts that cover your bandages & drains . Plus you ca n't shave your armpits so you will want them covered up ! After I could take off the surgical bra I wore soft camisoles . You will surely hurt the first week . I live 3 hours from the hospital and even the bumps in the road hurt on the way home . But you will make it though this ordeal and be closer to your daughters because of it .

0,"revkat - This is a good topic and thanks for bringing it up . I will be facing this decision down the road . Right now I 'm in the middle of my 2nd round of chemo -LRB- CMF -RRB- , then I get rads , then tamoxifen . I 'm nearing 53 and pre-menopausal . lewing - I also had quite a long period after round 1 of chemo ended . -LRB- I 'm hoping that one of the benefits of chemo is chemopause . -RRB- I should be finished with chemo and rads toward the end of the year and I thought I would get 5 years of tamoxifen . At one of my last visits with my oncologist , however , she mentioned that we may switch to an AI after two years or so , but she left it open . I 'm not sure what testing would be done to make a decision . darCraig - I hope the AI SE 's get better !! ",True

0,"As I understand it , the breast will drain into one primary sentinel node . Sometimes it becomes 2 nodes if they are nearby each other and the drainage is shared . Once a mx is done , there is no way to check which is the `` gatekeeper '' node any longer , so if there is a suspicion of CA , they 'll want to check the nodes along with the mx . However , if a mx is prophylactic , then no cancer is assumed . The risk for lymphedema is not a solid number at this time , as there are many variables , the primary one being how many lymph nodes were taken out . That said , there are those who have developed LE with no sentinel node disturbance - the mx surgery itself was enough . Things that can also set it off later down the road are : blood pressure taken , needle sticks , infected bug bites , pressure changes experienced while flying in a plane - anything which can compromise pressure or stimulate an inflammatory response . Some people are triggered more easily than others . Some swell more than others . It 's good to know about , since those unclear percentages of how many of us get it are somewhere between 5-30 % , depending upon which reports you read . A great site is : http://www.stepup-speakout.org which was created by some of our own breast cancer survivors who developed LE . They are medically trained , one being a doctor herself . I developed LE after Stage 1 . By Stage 2 I had been diagnosed and had read up on it . While at NOLA , there were extra steps needed to care for my affected arm , as well as my now - at-risk other arm . This is very important to know about so as to prevent this , if possible . Once it develops , it is permanent . ",True

But then on my final mamo prior to rad - there were still more calcs remaining - and now everyone is all over the place about what i should do - mx or rads . The rads camp says , just go for it and if later you need an mx , you 'll do it then - the mx camp says , how will you make a mx decision down the road , if your mamo still shows uncertain calcs - that we cant be sure of without removing them - either yet another lumpectomy or a mx . After a summer to think about it - i am going for a mx - because , i just wo n't be able to know how to evaluate future mamos that show calcs - I am wondering if i am hoping for more tumors to be found in the mx breast when they test it ?? Would the rads have killed off any tumors that may be remaining ?? Could I have saved my breast and had no negative consequences because it is a non aggressive tumor ?? Who knows ? ",True

5,"Well , it looks like I 'm back on the chemo train . Went to have liver biopsy and the Dr. decided not to do it because of the location of the tumor . It is at the top of the liver right against the diaphragm and the aorta , therefore too much risk of puncturing a lung or the aorta itself . As a result of that and a close look at the scans again , both Dr. Manfredi and Dr. Redd -LRB- the one who was to do the biopsy -RRB- agreed that it still had the characteristics of a cancerous tumor so we would start a new chemo regimen . I will now be taking Avastin at the cancer center every other week -LRB- that is the short one - only about 30 min to an hour -RRB- and will take a new chemo , Xeloda , in pill form -LRB- 7 days on and 7 days off -RRB- at home . This will go on for 8 weeks then we will rescan to see if this chemo has taken care of this remaining tumor . All other areas still remain cancer free after the initial rounds of chemo . The good thing about this treatment is that it will mean less time off work -LRB- the avastin treatments will be on Friday afternoons -RRB- for treatments/Dr . visits . ",True
0,"Hi , I was diagnosed one month before turning 47 . The ultrasound showed it was small -LRB- 8 mm -RRB- and so I thought this was not going to be a big deal , lumpectomy and rads . I met with my BS on Nov 5 , 2009 and I immediately knew he did n't think it was no big deal . He explained that it was Grade 3 and TN . When I met with my onc , she said that it had one of the highest mitotic -LRB- cell division -RRB- rates she had seen . My BS suggested I do the genetic test because of the TN , my age , and the fact that my paternal grandmother died from BC in her early 50s . I was fortunate to be able to do the test right then and found out my results a week later , BRCA1 + . We have now found that my sister is positive as well . She is 40 and just had her first mammo , everythings OK . Anyway , I chose Bi-lat because of the BRCA1 + , I did n't want to go down this road again . I had my bi-lat 2 days before my 47th birthday . My BS said I would never forget this birthday as it was the one in which I got rid of my cancer . I did 4 bi-weekly DD A/C treatments follow by 4 DD Taxol . I had my last Taxol on April 21 , 2010 . I am now on hair watch . I am scheduled to have my port removed in two weeks -LRB- yeah -RRB- .

These boards are a literal life saver , as you will find that everyone here is supportive in a way that no one else can be , unless they have been there done that .

YES ! Can I do it ? YES ! My best advice is to take any offers of support , food , rides to the doctor , etc. . Another thought is to try and schedule your chemo towards the end of the week so that you can take full advantage of your weekends off to recoup some . Good Luck , Michelle ",False
0,"Jeano , good tip about the thyroid . . maybe I 'll have a test -LRB- if I can possibly make myself have another blood test -RRB- . I met an amazing man yesterday who is building a shed and cabin over the road from our shed at the beach . He showed me all around his positively amazing finished projects -LRB- including a fish-smoker with an underground updrafting pipe from the fire to the hanging fillets in the smoking chamber -RRB- and his carefully hand-made kitchen benches . He was a little weird -LRB- apart from his fascinating English accent and Touretty conversation -RRB- . . he had a kind of ` chemo-lapse ' in his phrasing and waddya know ? He has cancer . He has a really rare blood cancer and collapsed immune system , and has chemo every month . He is in remarkable shape -LRB- he is 62 -RRB- and I think is taking most positive approach to whatever time he has left . He talked so emphatically about living life ` in this exact moment ' . We had so many laughs . He asked me if I minded talking about ` this stuff ' , and pointed out that he has no-one else to talk to about it , except doctors . Interesting , is n't it ? I think we will be good friends , and Drew can take him out in the tinny , which he will love . We are all just about one year out from chemo -LRB- my last date was Sept 26th -RRB- . Has this year flown , or am I just imagining it ? We booked a trip to Thailand for May next year . . the flights are so cheap . But I felt weird about planning something so far in advance....sigh.....cancer-residue . Love you all XXX ",False
2,tonlee ; I was 47 and bleeding heavily -LRB- probably a fibroid combined with peri-menopause -RRB- when I started chemo . I had one more period -LRB- light -RRB- and that was that !

0,"Hi Darlings Thank you so much for your messages , they mean so much coming as they do from the perspective of those a bit `` down the line '' from my position . So we share empathy that 's not patronising or misguide , or embarrsed . I feel strangely ok now . I was told by my the Oncies nurses that I might get 2 more courses of Tax -LRB- they KNOW their stuff -RRB- so I was expecting it , then the results of the histology of he tumour was soooo good . I think I was expecting the ax to fall and that was why I was so weepy after my good news . Thinking `` it ca n't be THAT easy , Netts , not with your luck ! '' I had the Consultant , Mr Yusef laughing . He is Egyptian , quite old and a genius -LRB- he was honoured by the Queen -RRB- , but is quite shy and unsmiling . Well before he introduced me to his young colleague who will he taking over my case I asked to be introduced to his grandson . He laughed out loud , which Angela the BC nurse who was in with me , said she had n't seen often , and rarely in a consultation . I just asked for the lads skin care routine cos he looked like he should be in primary school . It just seems 4 courses when I do n't have cancer in me seems a lot , especially getting Herceprin the day before . Of our group here in Scotland , there only 3 of us who are HER2 + , so no one here has had this kind of tharapy ! Can any one out there help ? They might stop at 2 courses , depending on how I tolerate it , so I have to keep a close diary of s/e , as some of them might become permanent.I think that 's why Martin , my bestest oncy , told me to prepare myself for 2 sessions of `` the yew tree poison '' . That kind of freaked me out !! What s/e might become permanent ??? They reckon the cancer was only about a year old and grew so fast and was n't ` hard ' , except round the edges , so difficult to detect by touch . Anyway , I think they recommend 4 courses as an ideal and I will try to take all 4 . I do n't understand why the Herceptrin is concurrent as the protocol is for 18 courses 3 weeks apart after chemo and rads . So I think I will have to have another 18 after rads as that seems to be the norm . Anyway , I literally trust Mr Yusef with my life . Literally !! Feel more positive now there is another challenge . At least now , I can not be turned down for DLA , -LRB- surely !! -RRB- which will be a huge weight of the finances . Some other bits of good news . My new Irish jig is lovely , really natural and exactly like a designer cut I had years ago , for which I paid a fortune -LRB- I uses to work for an oil company in the Shetland Isles -RRB- so spending was no biggie ... back then ! Anyway , I am really pleased with it , though I love having a cool shower , putting on a lovely cotton nightie -LRB- I have bought some really nice ones , can easily wear them to answer the door -RRB- and putting on a terry towelling head wrap to chill out after a sticky day . Adrinna , the fitter , shaved off the ` bum fluff ' hair on Monday and I have had real hair growing back already -LRB- I look like a Naxi -RRB- ! I will lose it again , of course , but hay ho . the worst of all these things has already happened ! OH lots of silver there where there was n't before , proof that chemo DOES age you !!! Going to lose my lashes again - boo hoo , they were just looking nice , and my nails . They 're horrible just now , but have n't fallen off ! AND my beautiful Dell pink rubberised laptop is fixed . Hurrah !!! And it only cost # 10 , not the # 316 I was quoted elsewhere !! I love that machine more that an inanimate thing has the right to be loved !!! It just needed cleaning of the bloody lemonade and the motherboard tightened . I promise I will never let anyone hurt it again . They will have to wear gloves it they touch it , under close supervision ! My wonderful brother Hugh had it repaired for me . I was going down to Blackpool today for a break before I am back on the treadmill , but was pretty sick yesterday , so will go tomorrow . Need to get all my dental work done before 31st when it all starts again , we were going to stagger it over 3 visits . Wow ! chemo really damages the teeth , minor damage certainly , but I need a veneer as my root canal work has discoloured . I paid # 190 last year to have it internally whitened , which worked too . So that 's the news from the front gals . Feeling quite positive . Always do for challenges and I know this is the best chance of beating this bugger stone dead and THAT 'S motivational . I am a stubborn bugger . AE , how is UB , responding to treatment ? Thank god they got it early . Reassure us ! Sue , Aloe Vera is wonderful for any kind of burn . I have a huge Aloe Vera plant and also a 500ml tube living in my fridge constantly . It 's dead cheap and pure 99.9 % pure - only # 4.99 from Holland and Barrett . Makes a lovely skin moisturiser too , Great as an after sun . But if your burn does n't respond , you have got to go to A & E if it is on your ` at risk ' arm . I was given 2 big leaflets from the hosp when I had surgery . 1 in 3 of us who had lymph removal will get lympheodema and injuries to the at risk arm are not to be dismissed.They might be serious .

I sneaked ` arse ' through customs ! -RRB- Where are you staying now ? It must be scary not having a roof over your head , tho ' it sounds like you have good support , if not space for stuff . Money worries suck too . I am not a breadhead , never worshipped money , but when there is more going out than coming in ... . stress on a new level.Your outlook , though , is inspirational . You sound like you have the most wonderful son . Lucky old you . Family can see you through ANY troubles . There is n't a day that I take my family for granted for what they have done to support me through all this . Judie !!!!!! Dinnae ! I gasped at your comment too.Had to re-read it twice . Funny , I developed a wee purple frekle -LRB- sp -RRB- on my boob , right over the tumour . Doc said it was nothing to worry about ! Maybe is was n't . Pretty colour it is . Cathi , my next door neighbour and her partner were separated , but amicable enough . One Sunday afternoon he called round to see the kids with his mum and sister , he was really pleasant to me as I was leaving the house to pick up the Sundays , and by the time I got back , 2 cars were screeching away from the house , I was just across the road so did n't see anything but heard raised voices . It took about 15 minutes as the shop is just down the road . Later that evening 2 policemen came to my door to see if I saw or heard anything . I tried to be helpful but did n't see anything at all , and only saw Peter knocking the door , and saw the cars driving away at speed . He had done to Joanne what your SIN did to Jacklyn . Jo was out of the house for 2 weeks and I was worried sick . The house was just empty . She came home after 2 weeks a wreck , terrified of her own shadow . She looked ok by then -LRB- she used Arnica gel on the bruising -RRB- , but they had taken pics and OMG she was black and blue . She too , had thumb marks on her neck , split lip etc and she got the police at once . She had met someone else -LRB- who now living with her and they are very happy -RRB- The red mist just decended on Peter , her ex . Ironic , as had lots of affairs and he left Jo ! -RRB- The case went to trial . I was initially called , but because I could contribute anything , was let off testifying . He was found ` not proven ' - a weird Scottish verdict that means they knew he was guilty but could n't prove it as there were no witnesses -LRB- rational was that it could have been the mum or the sister - they just knew she had been assaulted , and they claimed it was just a fight , not an assault -RRB- I always felt that if I just said I heard her screaming or saw something ... that might have made the difference.The kids heard it all , but the court would not accept their testimony as Jo might have `` groomed '' them . I have always felt a bit guilty for not backing her up be saying I saw something . But that would have been perjury . Anyway the upshot is the he can only see the kids under supervision and they do n't want anything to do with him -LRB- and HE was a devoted dad , especially to Louis -RRB- . Jo is with a lovely guy now who is great to the kids -LRB- and to me - they ca n't do enough for me since my dx -RRB- So there is hope for the future . Just make sure that he fulfils his financial responsibility to them . Your pic was great , we just do n't / ca n't get enough photos of Margot and the kids . How is Jacklyn doing ? Poor lass , she has n't had to seek her troubles , has she ? She has got a great mum though , and I 'll bet the house she knows it ! Has your other daughter and her Horrible Hubby decended on you yet ? Lay down the rules ! It 's much better if people know their boundries , including putting money in the pot !

4,"Hi all ! I just wanted to chime in on the Clomid thing again . I think it is strange that so many of us on here took it and ended up with BC in our 30 's however I did ask about it when I was diagnosed and told that they did not believe that there was a correlation but who knows , right ? My oncologist and I were saying it must have been the big microwaves in the ' 80 's or playing Atari as children ... lol . In other words no one knows why we got it or else they could cure it . I would like someone to study fertility meds and BC , though . So many of us on here took Clomid because we were in our 30 's and trying to get pregnant and I know my gyno gave it to me like it was nothing so I assume that is a common practice . I also know several women that took Clomid and have beautiful children now and no BC diagnosis . Who knows ? I am hating the cancer ride at this moment because I have to get an ultrasound tomorrow to rule out a swollen node on my left side . It is most likely scar tissue but I have scanxiety again .

2,"Hi , lieberman ~ As other have said , reviewing our choices and asking what we might have done differently is very normal , and something your Mother needs to go through . And I totally agree that no one wants to hear a rah-yay pep talk about being positive . But in retrospect , one thing that helped me a lot were the suggestions my DH or DS would make about how things may have worked out for the better in the long run . In my case , I had mediocre doctors at first , which I kicked myself for wasting time with . But my DH kept assuring me that it all worked out for the best because it led me to go to UCLA for a second opinion . I had a lumpectomy when I needed a mast , and my DH said maybe it was better to get the news in smaller pieces , because maybe it would have been harder to handle all at once . In your Mother 's situation , what comes to mind is that chemo options have improved greatly in the past few years . While not getting bc is obviously the preferable scenario , you can point out to your Mom that there are wonderful new chemo drugs on the scene that were n't available 5 years ago . Small `` good thing '' -LRB- or other side of the coin , or glass half full -RRB- ideas like that can help to stop the negative thought processes and hopefully let in some light and hope .

2,"Hollyann , I do n't know if you 're `` allowed '' to be here to read , but if you are , then you 're reading these posts for you . All women have different types of relationships . Some have men who can deal with their wife or partner 's breast cancer experience in a supportive way . Others do not . I 've heard my husband complain about the time I 've devoted to my online support , or `` blogs '' as he calls them , or going out with my girlfriends for fun . For me , my online bc sisters are n't blogs . For me , my bc support system has been a lifeline in many ways , and the friendships have grown beyond the topic of breast cancer . But deep down , a shared experience with breast cancer is always the common denominator , a more empathetic support than that of even the best of friends who have n't had it . Would n't it be great to have a seal of wellness , like the good housekeeping seal of approval ? Well , in the meantime , it 's been proven that women with support groups have less liklihood of breast cancer recurrence than those who do not . I do n't have a link to give you , but if you google support systems for breast cancer survivors and better survival , you 'll see . Would he mind if you kept in touch with your bc sisters just to do all you possibly can for your health , because there is truth to the mind/body connection . I think our men really just want life to return to their own normal eventually . They get weary . This must be why we 're the stronger sex . I can not imagine my own husband dealing with all the things women take in stride - let alone breast cancer . If the man ca n't be strong enough to support you when you need it - to give you that lift when you need it - to give you the light of day when things are feeling dark , then you must do for you what you would tell your own daughter or best friends to do . You 're of more help to those around you when your own mind is at ease , than if you are an unsupported ball of worry . Just do n't forget yourself in the effort to please a man . ~ hanna ",True

I 'm 56 and ca n't help but think I 'm at greater risk with family history . Maternal grandmother also had BC , had mastectomy - lived to age 88 ! Onc # 1 spoke with a group from Sloan-Kettering about my case and he came back to me with an option to do CMF as opposed to the harsher and shorter regime of TC .

2,"Liz , My husband loves my foobs because he loves me . Yes , they deform when I flex , which certainly happens during sex , but mostly we 've been in the dark or dim light , so I 've felt a little better about it , as they were n't as visible . I think regular silicone that is placed sub-pectorally will also deform during flexing too , because it is under the muscle , not necessarily because it 's a gummy . I wonder if someone who has had both can chime in on that ? I still occasionally wear a top too during sex . He would n't care if we were under fluorescent lights and he could see every ripple , dent , or oddity . He knows I 'm self conscious about them so does n't push me to disrobe when I do n't want to . I think he picks up on my vibe of `` this area is a no fly zone '' , and has respected that . I do n't have sensation back , and that does bother me , but I 'm told that may return in time . If it does n't , he 'll just continue to search for more `` responsive '' zones . I 've read every one of your posts from your first one over a year ago , because I too have really had a problem with the dents , bumps , bubbles , ridges , etc , of these door stops that now reside on my chest masquerading as boobs . I felt better reading your posts when you said that they loosed up and you were ok with the firmness now . I am also going to try fat grafting at some point in the near future . My PS wants me to wait because of the extra surgeries I needed for the infection I got . I feel for you going through this single , but please know that most guys will be too distracted with the fact that they are in bed with a beautiful , sexy and totally fabulous woman to notice what you see as glaringly obvious . Every time I call my husband in to the bathroom to look at a new `` deformity , '' that I 'd discovered , he actually has to really search for what I 'm seeing . Your new boyfriend will likely do that too . He will know about what you 've been through before you get to the point where you are in bed together , and will be sensitive to your feelings . My husband is just so happy that I 'm alive and doing well that I think he would n't care what I looked like . During that 5 week period after my infection when I only had one expander , he still wanted to be with me . To me I never looked worse , and thought my right side looked like an old lady without her teeth in . He did n't care . I , on the other hand , have n't been really that interested in sex for awhile since all this happened . BC can rip away at ones sexuality like nothing else . My husband looks at reconstructed , and un-reconstructed boobs for a living , and that may dull the impact of mine a little bit , but I think that regardless of the fact that he deals with cancer every day , he would still love my foobs for what they are , because of who they are attached to , not what they look like when flexing in a certain position . I will reiterate what many others have posted here , if he has a problem with the way you look or feel , then he is n't the man for you . There are so many men out there that will not just accept them , but LOVE them ! One thing I learned in my dating years ... Men do n't care how they look necessarily . It does n't matter what size , shape , or texture , if they are lucky enough to get some one on one time with them , they are happy as can be ! Now a question for you ... Has the fat grafting really helped with the dented appearance ? Are you still considering an exchange for traditional silicone ? Thank you for starting this thread Liz , it has been immensely helpful to me hearing about others experiences . I do n't feel so alone anymore . ",False

0,"1 and 2whocares , your sister feels overwhelmed and shocked already . Being diagnosed with breast cancer forces you into making so many decisions in areas you are completely unaware of until you 've researched it all . She will pick up your energy if you are `` trying to keep POSITIVE energy going '' even if your are feeling negative . It sounds like you are all very involved with each other . Don ; t feel upset if you notice her being distant with you . That is normal . After all it 's about her , and even though you are all in shock , her cancer is about her and how she feels rigfht now . Let her sort it out with her husband , for they are in shock and have to sort thru all of their feelings . She ; s not in a position to worry about your feelings right now , and wo n't . She may resent you if you make her breast cancer all about how you feel . Yes cancer affects the whole family but she is the one who has to go thru the pain surgeries , and now possibly another surgery on her lymph nodes , and decisions about reconstructive surgeries , chemo and it 's side effects , and the fear of dying and not being there for her kids . Try to let her decide how she wants to share all of this with you . You all have a rough road together ahead . ",True

5,"Well , yesterday morning I woke up so nauseated I thought I was going to hurl before we even left the house . I did n't sleep AT ALL that night and looked like total HELL !!! We took the train in had lunch at the Brigham and Women 's cafeteria -LRB- much better than Dana Farber 's FYI if you ever need to know -RRB- because it took me two hours to even think of eating ANYTHING . We get to Dana , and I sign in and find out that my onc is running an hour late , so I go in to panic mode and say I am supposed to start at 2:30 what do we do ? Do we go without talking to her panic panic panic !!! So the very nice lady , obviously used to crazy people told us to go to the waiting room for my vitals . On the way in this tech stopped me and told me my fly was open . So I 'm called in for my vitals , and it 's the same lab tech ! And I just love her !! I go in and she asked the dreaded `` are you having any pain ? '' question , and I told her that actually all the cancer was gone in the operation and this was all preventative chemo . I also told her my blood pressure was going to be sky high and we took bets on it , and I won . She was awesome . She had me laughing before I was out of there and I wish I could get her every time . Then I go in for the IV . I get the thing put in and then the tech says you are getting bla bla and HERCEPTIN and I am like NO I 'M NOT !!! -LRB- Blood pressure back to 140/100 pulse through the roof -RRB- So she says well that 's ok just check with the doc before you go up . So we have about a 45 minute wait where I see another woman who is starting today , someone with a hand full of films and another woman who reminded me of me who was clearly at the beginning of her nightmare and num because she was jabbering in this overly happy , numb way that I did at the beginning . I really felt for her especially because she had this gorgeous thick blond hair that went down to the middle of her back and I knew she would be having an even tougher time than I was with this . It was too bad too because she was alone . My heart went out to her . Anyway , we finally get in and my doctor 's nurse practitioner is there and she asks me how I am doing and I start going a mile a minute about how scared I am about everything and I freak out about the whole Herceptin thing . That was straightened out . I guess because they had to reserve the longest infusion time and the actual order went up with me . And I was give all the facts and in the middle my oncologist came in and it was all good and I went up to the infusion room . Each chair had its own area that could be closed off if you wanted to , my nurse was awesome ! I am on four rounds of Cytoxin and Andriamycin followed by four rounds of Taxol . I wish that the doc would say this is the cure . But they wo n't and I understand but I want to hear that word so bad it hurts . But 85 % chance of never dealing with this again is nothing to complain about ! So while I sit through the infusion , my darling husband runs around to fill the nausea med prescription and make the appointment in Plastic Surgery and for the wig styling for me and I feel totally fine . We took the subway back to the train station and realize that the train riding days are over . My husband says he does n't want me to catch the `` SARS-Bird-Flu-Malaria '' on the train ! I love how he can make me laugh no matter what ! I woke up at 4:00 am with my stomach feeling queasy . I do n't know if it was because of the chemo or nerves . But I took the meds at 8:00 am anyway . I am popping in to work only long enough to get some work to do at home . My shots came to the house yesterday and hubby was shown how to give them to me so that is all set . I have decided not to get my hair cut today . I will do it next week . Actually I am feeling better about the whole thing this morning for some reason . Maybe because there were so many people in one place yesterday talking about it to me and taking it in stride . This one lady heard me talking about how horrified I was with the nurse and she came right over to talk . I guess I am still amazed at the kindness of people , and how they have been reaching out to me . Maybe its because I am a child abuse survivor . I know that this whole experience has brought a lot of issues I thought were dead and buried back that has n't been fun . But I have to say to all of you who I absolutely value more than I ever expected , I am in a much more peaceful place this morning . I did not wake up afraid for the first time in many months and that is a huge surprise especially because I think of how terrified I was yesterday . I know this will not all be smooth sailing but I feel like most of the `` unknown '' is out of the picture now and that makes it a lot easier to deal with . Thanks for reading , I know this was a book !!! Love to all !!!! Robyn ",False

2,"My father was DX with breast cancer 8 years ago . Even though we have no other family history of breast cancer in my family I wanted to be proactive as it is rare for men to have breast cancer . I had my baseline mammogram when I was 37 and was normal and was told not to come back till I turned 40 . I turned 40 early this year and went for my second mammogram in March 2010 . I received a call back for additional pictures of the Rt breast . Second set of films showed micro calcifications -LRB- 80 % chance of being nothing -RRB- and a subsequent BX showed -LRB- I was in the crappy 20 % -RRB- 8 cm of DCIS in the Rt breast . Scary but 100 % treatable and not life threatening . Had a lumpectomy in April 2010 , and my world took a turn for the worst . Pathology showed 0.4 mm of invasive grade 2 , ER/PR + , HER - cancer with angiolymphatic invasion was reported present on path . Had genetic testing and was BRCA 1 normal BRCA 2 was `` suspected deleterious '' , which meant although not 100 % positive it should be treated as positive . In light of this I opted for a double mastectomy in early June just to be on the safe side and the pathology from this surgery showed to have no additional new invasive cancer since the April lumpectomy and the nodes were clean and negative . Had OncoDX test done and result was 21 , which put me in the low end of the intermediate group -LRB- gray zone -RRB- . Radiation was ruled out since double MX took care of the margins . Primary Oncologist is recommending 4 cycles of T/C due to the angiolymphatic invasion found on the path report in April . She said if that had not been present she would not recommend chemo as the tumor was so small . However , got 2nd opinion from a Oncologist at Stanford , and they said they could recommend chemo but would not push -LRB- as my primary oncologist seems to be doing -RRB- and they seem to be making this determination based upon tumor size even though angiolymphatic invasion was noted . Stanford also suggested Tamoxifan & Zoladex might be a good way for me to go instead of chemo , but my primary oncologist never suggested this . But of course Stanford said there is no right or wrong choice and it is ultimately my decision . That is what I am having a problem with . I do n't have any children and was hoping to try this year -LRB- hence the check-up at my b-day -RRB- when all this was discovered . A fertility DR stated I have a 100 % chance of going into early menopause if I do chemo , which is of course a major concern for me . If I already had kids the decision of chemo would already have been made . However , the reality is I dont and would still like to . So now what do I do . Tamoxifan is a given as both Oncology Drs seem to agree that the majority of reduction of reoccurrence -LRB- 7 % -RRB- will be from the hormone therapy . Meanwhile chemo would only offer and additional 3 % . I would be interested in knowing if any women are in a similar situation as mine . I really and truly do not know how to decide . It seems if I do what my primary oncologist wants I will have to give up my dream of a child that is biologically mine , but if I do n't do chemo and distant reoccurrence occurs down the line how do I reconcile that I did n't do all that I could when I had the chance . Is anyone going through this as well ? ",True

0,"Lorena , It actual sounds like your tumor is invasive like mine and also aggresive . I also had two areas in the same breast with DCIS .

During the procedure , I had my plastic surgeon performing a lift and nipple reduction to my good breast while the general was removing my right .

I am hopeful , as with my plastic surgeon , that down the road , if my armpit has not sustained too much damage from the radiation I would undergo the trans flap reconstruction . I am with you , the oncologist has indicated that radiation is not necessary but all he had to say was that if I was his wife or daughter and knowing the benefits vs the risks , he would recommend the radiation . I am hopeful that I can have the trans flap down the road , but if not , the implant would be just fine with me . What ' important is that you feel you are making the right decisions and your comfortable with your Doctors . Good luck to you , I will be thinking of you . Roxi ",True
6,"I have been on and off of tamoxifen for 2ξ1/2 years . I am not consistent with taking pills everyday , and the se 's can be annoying . I have joint pain continuously and hot flashes and low libido every now and then . I think my main concern is that I have endometriosis and that pain is severe since tamoxifen can cause uterine cancer . I had heard about a metabolizing test for tamoxifen to see if it is actually helping , but i have n't mentioned it to my doctor as of yet . I would like to know if anyone has ever switched from tamoxifen to chemo , because I am so bad at not taking my pills even though they are right in front of me , but the need is just not there to take them , and my onc wants me to take a calcium pill along with an anti depressant because of se 's of tamoxifen . I have never been a pill popper and I will not start now . Is there anyone in the same boat as me ? ",True
0,"Booblet , you 're young and healthy , and yes , you deserve reconstruction ! The advantage to choosing to reconstruct now as opposed to later is that you 'll have less scarring with immediate reconstruction . I had a small tumor in my right breast , but due to family history , MRI that missed my cancer , desire for symmetry , DIEP only possible once , and having had three biopsies in the left breast , I decided to have a bilateral mastectomy with immediate DIEP . I woke up with breasts , so I never really had to deal with the sense of loss that so many have . Yes , they were changed , but the girls were still there . I only have numbness in the center of each breast , and the numb area of my abdomen is only 4 '' x 4 '' . My ab scar has faded so much that I do n't mind it at all -- the tummy tuck bonus was so worth it ! I did have some bumps in the road , and had to find a real DIEP expert when I realized my first surgeon was n't going to give me the beautiful outcomes I was seeing online . I had a few more surgeries than most DIEP patients do , but it 's been totally worth it and I can smile -LRB- and thank God ! -RRB- when I look in the mirror . The only pain I had by the time I left the hospital was from the drains , and that was gone a few days later .

0,"Hi Laura ... I have only been on this site a month or so and it has been incredibly helpful to me . Like you , I do n't have any friends that have been down this BC road , and there is just no way someone can truly understand if they have not experienced it firsthand . Here in my area the only reconstruction options were TE/implants and TRAM . I was not happy with either of those for various reasons . The TRAM did not appeal to me because of the abdominal muscle loss , and because it was going to be a 12 hour surgery here -LRB- because they do about 1 a month here vs other surgeons that do a few a week -RRB- . I 'd read about the DIEP -LRB- none of my Drs here even mentioned it !! -RRB- but because I 'd have to travel it seemed not to be an option . But the women on this board made it very clear that traveling for DIEP was not only doable , but well worth it if that is the surgery you feel is right for you . I think it is probably only because of this board and other 's sharing their DIEP experiences that I decided to look into it seriously . I traveled to MD and NY -LRB- from VA -RRB- to meet with two different surgeons and decided to have my surgery in NY . For me , I know this is the right surgery . It is another one of those huge decisions , which seem to just keep coming in this BC journey . I do understand and wish you luck with the process . ~ Suzanne ",True
2,"i understand your fear , kayson ; but if your looking to improve your odds of reoccurence , chemo is the best way to go . i read an article before chemo that IF there is deadly effects while DOING chemo , its a basd shot in the port . every chemo suite has a drug they immediatly give you that COMPLETELY reverses the problem . i was so paranoid , i made my nurses show me the drug before i would take cemo . i have ms and the WORST thing for me to take was nuelasta , as it boosts the immune system , which mine is way out of whack from ms. i came to trust my nurses tremendously , and i finished 22 chemo treatments . i got some hard s/es , but im alive today , and cancer free as of the last set of scans . its all scary ; but if no neulasta , then you can die from infection alone . my cancer was very small , 1cm. , each . . i actually had 2 . but it was very aggresive . i truly feel if i hasdnt found the inner strength to do the chemo , i would not have survived . however , we all make our own decisions . i just know i can look back , and say aggresive cancer = aggresive treatment . i wish you well , however you go . please dont let fear rule your decissions . find a peaceful spot inside you , and let fear subside in yor decisions ... they truly DO know what theyre doing with chemo . . im out 11/2 yrs now , and counting.bless you . light and love 3jaysmom ",True

2,"Dearest Roxy , You are nearing the end of Rads with fortitude of body per your description , and inquiring of mind per your post : both bode so well for you along your breast cancer journey . You raise valid questions regarding two of your tumor 's specific markers : the ki67 -LRB- cell proliferation -RRB- and mutation of the p53 gene -LRB- a cell `` stress '' detection gene -RRB- . Yet the experts themselves caution us not to read into any one or two specific markers/genes too much , as it takes a village to describe one 's picture more fully . This village to date may best demonstrated by the Oncotype DX , which until now has been used for node negative breast cancer . I understand since your situation involved a node , this test was mostlikely not run . Recently , some experts have noted it may help in node positive breast cancer too , as it provides a 21 factor analysis . Matthew Ellis , in a recent Journal of NCI editorial states of this test : '' When compared with the positive results obtained by Paik et al. -LRB- 3 -RRB- with the 21-gene recurrence score assay , which was able to identify a group of high-risk , node - negative , hormone receptor -- positive patients who differentially experienced benefit from CMF , the results reported by Viale et al. -LRB- 1 -RRB- serve to emphasize the point that predicting chemotherapy sensitivity in the hormone receptor -- positive subgroup requires an assay that integrates more biologic parameters than just the baseline rate of cell cycle progression '' . -LRB- Edit : the ki67 suggest cell cycle progression -RRB- . As to your question of would a full mastectomy in light of a mutated p53 gene -LRB- hence a cranked up stress gene more than a calm , behind the scene one of low stress -RRB- well this is a question for a breast cancer expert . It 's a valid question , and if your doctor wo n't give you an answer , you might appeal to your HMO/Primus to allow you , on the basis of these marker/gene studies . to travel to a Comprehensive or University based Cancer Center . I 'd just type of a letter requesting formal breast expert consultation and submit it to the committee along with your pathology sheet . Even your HMO/Primus allowing a telephone consultation/review may be helpful to ease your valid questions with valid answers . So , where does this leave you Roxy ? Well , your therapy is nearing its end , aside from hormonal therapy for the high estrogen receptor status . I ca n't recall whether you do or do not have PR receptors ? But having high estrogen receptor status clearly puts you in the captains seat in a positive way . You already are pushing for the oophorectomies which will allow an AI , or aromatase inhibitor , which have been shown to slightly improve disease free recurrence , and one -LRB- Letrozole -RRB- to be shown to increase Long Term disease free recurrence . So , in the end , beg , plead , and ... well , beg again for Letrozole just because of your specific circumstances . In the short term , do everything you can to hurry up the surgery : make sure your part of the paper work is done , appeal if necessary by letter the information as provided above and why it may be beneficial to you to have your surgery sooner than 3 months , and hey , what it would it be without me putting in a plug for immediate testing of your ability to even metabolize Tamoxifen into it 's active drug : endoxifen . This is done by simple blood or cheek swab on your own DNA , and sent of to a lab like Mayo , or LabCorp or DNA direct , and is called the CYP2D6 gene analysis .

OK so 3 weeks ago I had tx and the following week I had blood work and they said my platlets were 26 thousand and the following week they went up to 34 thousand and this week they dropped back down to 26 thousand so how did they do that ? My wbc and rbc are down to . My bone scan is about the same he said so all this and I have nothing positive out of it exept that my TM 's went down 10points , If my platlets went down in 3 weeks how does one expect them to jump up over a 100 thousand in 1 week . He has me scheduled for chemo next wed. . I really do not think that is going to happen . I layed awake last night thinking that all those little cancer cells are having a party knowing that they did not get blasted with chemo yesterday . Has anyone had low platlets and how long did it take for them to come up over 100 . He said it would be useless to do a platlet transfusion because it only lasts 2 days and he can not do transfusion every 2 days unless it is an emergency . I am so mad that there is no change in my bone scan . He is going to lower the dose when I do have chemo again . If a high dose did not do anything than how is a lower dose going to work .

Wondering if I need to worry about alcohol consumption to avoid a reccurence even though I 've had a double mastectomy ? I have always been a light to moderate drinker , but part of the reason the mastectomy was so appealing is I felt like I would n't have to worry about the cancer coming back and second guess everything I was eating/drinking .

The only thing for certain is that I will need my lymph nodes removed and post surgery radiation . One day I 'm leaning toward a lumpectomy the other a bmx . Lumpectomy for cosmetic and recovery reasons . BMX for piece of mind . I 'm not super attached to my breast but the thought of choosing to mutilate myself for piece of mind seem a little extreme too .

0,"I have just gone through the difficult process of deciding lumpectomy vs mastectomy myself . For me it was perhaps the hardest part of the whole process . I spent weeks researching and talking with others about what would be best . To me it seemed lumpectomy with radiation followed by tamoxiphen seemed to be the overwhelming `` thing to do '' on these boards and even by some of the doctors I consulted . After all I was told I had only a very small area of dcis and that was only in my left breast . It seemed everyone was saying the same thing , lumpectomy with radiation had the same survival outcome as mastectomy . Especially when you add tamoxiphen to the mix . In the end I had bilateral mastectomy and here was my reasoning and conclusions . First survival rates and recurrence rates are two different things . Mastectomies gave the lowest risk of recurrence obviously . Lumpectomy even with radiation had a significantly higher risk for recurrence and as my surgeon said . Dcis is a sneaky thing . It can sometimes be in more places than original known , it can be more extensive than originally thought -LRB- since it travels through the duct system -RRB- and if and when it recurs it can be as dcis or as invasive . At that point its a whole new ballgame . For now there are no perfect tests to 100 % tell you exactly what is hiding in those breasts . Only on the final pathology can you know that . Many women here can testify to additional areas of dcis or invasive being found on the final pathology that no one knew existed . You can also not be on this site long before you see how many tests miss cancers that are already known to be there . Mri 's , mammograms , ultrasound etc. are not 100 % perfect tests at knowing whats there especially in women who have dense breast tissue . My surgeon also said many doctors just are n't sure how to treat dcis . Some dcis may never break through and become invasive while others do . What makes some dcis change and become invasive ? They know that in mice it does happen sometimes in a span of months but are not sure what causes the change . Also some women can have a large amount of dcis and no invasion . Others can have a small amount of dcis and have microinvasion or invasion . Anytime you have invasion you can have the potential for metastasis . Plus since my dcis was in my left breast it would mean having radiation so that was another whole area of researching . Each treatment for cancer has its own set of side effects . Radiation is never 100 % safe either . The statistics look pretty good for awhile out but now they are starting to see the cardiac side effects down the road . Radiation can damage the blood vessels that run close to the chest wall . Newer technology helps to protect the lung and heart but there is no one who can guarantee 100 % that no part of the heart/and or lungs will go unaffected by the radiation scatter . So women who do the radiation need to know there can be a chance that they may develop heart or lung problems later in life from the radiation treatment they had from breast cancer . Only time will show how significant these issues will be from todays radiation techniques . Even taking the tamoxiphen will have its side effects . Some will tolerate it well others wo n't . So at the end of all this research I came to these conclusions for myself . With breast cancer there are no absolute guarantees , no perfect doctors , no perfect tests and no one solution for everyone . Doctors try to help what they can , women try to choose the best they can , and the treatments we have now try to find and cure cancer the best they can . In the end my pathology came back that there was only the tiny area of dcis in my left breast , no surprises there . However my `` good breast '' the one taken off prophylactically came back with cell changes that put me at a higher risk for developing cancer in that breast at a future date . Something I did n't want to have to deal with again . But even if it had n't come back that way for me the bilateral was the right decision because I did n't want the additional risks associated with the radiation or the tamoxiphen . I do want to add that if mine had been invasive then those risks would have been ones I would readily have taken on in order to fight the breast cancer . No one wants to take radiation or chemo but if those are the only tools one has to fight with then thats what you have to do till they come up with something better . And yes even bilateral mastectomy is not 100 % guarantee that cancer will not come back because there is no guarantee that every breast cell is taken out during a mastectomy , but it has been and still is the best option they have out there with the lowest risk of recurrence . I 'd encourage anyone at this decision point to google recurrence rates for each treatment currently available . Go back to the original articles everyone likes to quote and see for yourself what they have to say . My prayer is that they will find a cure so no one else will have to make these agonizing decisions . ",True
